# YourMom 

This is a HCI (human-computer interaction) project for the Sapienza University bachelor degree in ACSAI. 
We are a group of students working on it: Francesca Cinelli, Chiara Pennini, Dana Rabandiyar, Anna Maria Houbraken and Ferola Hima. 

The project is a mobile webapp that lets you choose daily tasks to follow to build habits which have to be completed daily to make your virtual mom happy so she can give you rewards which are recipes. Moreover the app includes some daily challenges which are extra tasks that change everyday and that your virtual pet dog gives you which will make the app more fun to play with.
